# Build New Preview Workflow

**Goal:** Turn user intent into a hardened, reviewable artifact.

**CRITICAL:** If a step directs you to another snapshot file, read it fully and follow it. No exceptions.

Subagents, when the capability is available, are an important part of this workflow. Use them as directed by the workflow steps.
If you need an explicit user instruction to run them, ask once now for the whole workflow run.

## READY FOR DEVELOPMENT STANDARD

A specification is "Ready for Development" when:

- **Actionable**: Every task has a file path and specific action.
- **Logical**: Tasks ordered by dependency.
- **Testable**: All ACs use Given/When/Then.
- **Complete**: No placeholders or TBDs.
- **Sufficient**: No known requirement, acceptance, dependency, or implementation gaps remain unresolved.
- **Coherent**: No unresolved ambiguities or internal contradictions.
- **Đo được ở ranh giới**: nếu story cắt qua hai process, hai origin, một socket, trình duyệt ↔ server, hay ta ↔ nhà cung cấp bên ngoài, thì `## Probe ranh giới` đã khai probe chạy ở ĐÚNG tầng đó và nêu được mutation làm nó đỏ. Nếu không cắt qua ranh giới nào, section đã bị xoá. Đây là tiêu chí duy nhất trong danh sách này ra đời từ số đếm chứ không từ nguyên tắc: Epic 1 có bảy lần lớp lỗi "test ở hai đầu một seam, không gì chạy khúc giữa", năm trong bảy chỉ bị bắt vì có người tự dựng probe, và lần thứ bảy sống trên sản phẩm qua cả bảy story trong lúc ba suite đều xanh.

## SCOPE STANDARD

A specification should target a **single user-facing goal** within **900–1600 tokens**:

- **Single goal**: One cohesive feature, even if it spans multiple layers/files. Multi-goal means >=2 **top-level independent shippable deliverables** — each could be reviewed, tested, and merged as a separate PR without breaking the others. Never count surface verbs, "and" conjunctions, or noun phrases. Never split cross-layer implementation details inside one user goal.
  - Split: "add dark mode toggle AND refactor auth to JWT AND build admin dashboard"
  - Don't split: "add validation and display errors" / "support drag-and-drop AND paste AND retry"
- **900–1600 tokens**: Optimal range for LLM consumption. Below 900 risks ambiguity; above 1600 risks context-rot in implementation agents.
- **Neither limit is a gate.** Both are proposals with user override.

## Conventions

- Every operational cross-file reference in this workflow is an absolute snapshot path. Open it directly; do not resolve it relative to a skill directory.
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- Whenever this workflow captures or records a version-control revision, obtain the full canonical identifier directly from version control and preserve it verbatim.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each of these steps in order before proceeding (`_None._` means skip):

{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}

### Step 2: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry below as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` -- load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim (`_None._` means none):

{workflow.persistent_facts}

### Step 3: Execute Append Steps

Execute each of these steps in order (`_None._` means skip):

{workflow.activation_steps_append}

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is self-contained and followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only load the current step file
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Complete steps in order, no skipping
- **State Tracking**: Persist progress via spec frontmatter and in-memory variables
- **Append-Only Building**: Build artifacts incrementally

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Read the entire step file before acting
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute sections in order
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at checkpoints and wait for human
4. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- **ALWAYS** halt at checkpoints and wait for human input
